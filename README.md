# Wine-Review-Data-Analysis
A detailed data analysis of wine reviews from a Kaggle dataset


Original dataset is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews#winemag-data_first150k.csv

I focussed on the Chardonnay variety of white wine and analysed cost and quality across the main producing regions in the world.
